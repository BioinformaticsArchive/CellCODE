\title{
Assign cell population using correlation
}

\usage{
cellPopC(data, grp, SPVs)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
Gene expression data
}
  \item{grp}{
Clinical group factors. Used only to remove the group effect before correlation computation.
}
  \item{SPVs}{
A matrix of cell proportion variable with a row for each sample of data and a column for each cell type
}
}

\value{
A gene by cell-type matrix of correlation coefficients
}

## The function is currently defined as
function (data, grp, SPVs) 
{
    out = matrix(nrow = nrow(data), ncol = ncol(SPVs))
    colnames(out) = colnames(SPVs)
    rownames(out) = rownames(data)
    data = resid(data, grp)
    for (i in 1:ncol(SPVs)) {
        out[, i] = cor(t(data), SPVs[, i])
    }
    out
  }
