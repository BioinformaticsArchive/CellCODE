\title{
SVD with group interaction
}
\description{
Finds the main axis of variation from a small submatrix of expression data while accounting for experimental group and group-eigenvector interactions effects.

}
\usage{
svdIntGrp(dat, grp, cutoff = 0.3)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dat}{
Expression matrix data with genes in rows and samples in columns
}
  \item{grp}{
A factor variable of experimental groups 
}
  \item{cutoff}{
The fraction of genes to discard based on group effect
}
}

\Value{
A single eigenvector of the reduced expression matrix
}
